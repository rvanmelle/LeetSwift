# LeetSwift

One of the problems with being a mobile developer is that you rarely write algorithms, 
almost never manipulate strings, and generally do not exercise the programming language
or brain skills typically required in technical coding interviews.

## Parts

- **Problems.playground**: These are mostly problems encountered on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) 
or in technical interviews.

## Solved Problems

These are all solved as pages in the playground. Some of them such as the Sodoku solver will render the solution to screen.
